Question 6
Suppose that you have written a time server, which periodically notifies its clients
of the current date and time. Write an interface that the server could use to
enforce a particular protocol on its clients.
Ans.
package com.org.gen.day3;

import java.time.*;
public interface TimeClient {
 void setTime(int hour, int minute, int second);
 void setDate(int day, int month, int year);
 void setDateAndTime(int day, int month, int year,
 int hour, int minute,
int second);
 LocalDateTime getLocalDateTime();
}
